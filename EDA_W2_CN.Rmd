## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.



##Week 2

##Lattice Plotting System

For making many many plots at once, useful to see looking at one varialbe by other variables

lattice package also includes grid package. but we seldom call functions from the grid package directly.

lattice plotting system does not have a two-phase aspect like the base system.

you have to plot with a single function call


xyplot: for making scatterplots
bwplot : box-and-whiskers plots(boxplots)
histogram: histograms
stripplot: like a boxplot but with actual points
dotplot : plot dots on "violin strings
splom: scatterplot matrix; like *pairs* in base plotting system
levelplot, contourplot: for plotting "image" data


#details
xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data)

f and g are conditioning variables, they are optional

```{r}
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind , data = airquality)

```

```{r}
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout = c(5, 1))
```
multidimensional panels are very simple with just one line.




#behavior

base graphics functions plot data directly to the graphics device

lattice graphics functions return an object of class trellis

lattice functions return 'plot objects'

on the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed


```{r}
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)
#nothing happens
print(p)
#plot appears
```



##Part 2

lattice functions have a panel function which controls what happens inside each panel of the plot.

panel functions receive the x/y coordinates of the data points in their panel

```{r}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
f <- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y <- x + f - f * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
f <- factor(f, labels = c("Group1", "Group2"))
xyplot(y ~ x | f, layout = c(2,1))
```



```{r}
#Custom panel function
xyplot(y ~ x|f, panel = function(x, y, ...){
        panel.xyplot(x, y, ...) # First call default panel function
        panel.abline(h = median(y), lty = 2) #Add a horizontal line at the median
})
```


```{r}
xyplot(y ~ x|f, panel = function(x, y, ...){
        panel.xyplot(x, y, ...) # First call default panel function
        panel.lmline(x, y, col = 2) #overlay a simple linear regression line
})
```


##YOU CAN'T MIX FUNCTIONS FROM DIFFERENT PLOTTING SYSTEMS

#many panel lattice plot
baltimore astma study

question: how does indoor airborne mouse allergen vary over time and accross subjects?

150 subjects
each with 5 visits

*easiest way is lattice plot*

ders slaytinda var ama burada data olmadigi icin plot yok.

you can see variation accross subjects, variations within subjects

you can see missing values. all subjects must have 5 points, but some have 3 or less in the plot. why is the data missing

#summary

lattice system is ideal for creating conditioning plots where you examine the same kind of plot under many different conditions

##ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

implementation of the *Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson

written by Hadley Wickham while he was a graduate student at Iowa State

a "third" graphics system for R, along with *base* and *lattice*

www.ggplot2.org

- think 'verb' 'noun' and 'adjective' for graphics

you want to shorten the distance from mind to page

allows for a 'theory' of graphics


qplot()
works much like the plot() function in base graphics

looks for data in a data frame, similar to lattice, or in the parent environment

plots are made up of aesthetics(size, shape, color) and geoms(points, lines)

factors are important for indicating subsets of the data(if they are to have different properties); they should be labeled

the qplot() hides what goes on underneath, which is okay for most operations

ggplot() is the core function and very flexible for doing things qplot() cannot do.
