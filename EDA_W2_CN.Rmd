## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Lattice Plotting System

For making many many plots at once, useful to see looking at one varialbe by other variables

lattice package also includes grid package. but we seldom call functions from the grid package directly.

lattice plotting system does not have a two-phase aspect like the base system.

you have to plot with a single function call


xyplot: for making scatterplots
bwplot : box-and-whiskers plots(boxplots)
histogram: histograms
stripplot: like a boxplot but with actual points
dotplot : plot dots on "violin strings
splom: scatterplot matrix; like *pairs* in base plotting system
levelplot, contourplot: for plotting "image" data


#details
xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data)

f and g are conditioning variables, they are optional

```{r}
library(lattice)
library(datasets)
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind , data = airquality)

```

```{r}
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | Month, data = airquality, layout = c(5, 1))
```
multidimensional panels are very simple with just one line.




#behavior

base graphics functions plot data directly to the graphics device

lattice graphics functions return an object of class trellis

lattice functions return 'plot objects'

on the command line, trellis objects are auto-printed


```{r}
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind, data = airquality)
#nothing happens
print(p)
#plot appears
```



##Part 2

lattice functions have a panel function which controls what happens inside each panel of the plot.

panel functions receive the x/y coordinates of the data points in their panel

```{r}
set.seed(10)
x <- rnorm(100)
f <- rep(0:1, each = 50)
y <- x + f - f * x + rnorm(100, sd = 0.5)
f <- factor(f, labels = c("Group1", "Group2"))
xyplot(y ~ x | f, layout = c(2,1))
```



```{r}
#Custom panel function
xyplot(y ~ x|f, panel = function(x, y, ...){
        panel.xyplot(x, y, ...) # First call default panel function
        panel.abline(h = median(y), lty = 2) #Add a horizontal line at the median
})
```


```{r}
xyplot(y ~ x|f, panel = function(x, y, ...){
        panel.xyplot(x, y, ...) # First call default panel function
        panel.lmline(x, y, col = 2) #overlay a simple linear regression line
})
```


##YOU CAN'T MIX FUNCTIONS FROM DIFFERENT PLOTTING SYSTEMS

#many panel lattice plot
baltimore astma study

question: how does indoor airborne mouse allergen vary over time and accross subjects?

150 subjects
each with 5 visits

*easiest way is lattice plot*

ders slaytinda var ama burada data olmadigi icin plot yok.

you can see variation accross subjects, variations within subjects

you can see missing values. all subjects must have 5 points, but some have 3 or less in the plot. why is the data missing

#summary

lattice system is ideal for creating conditioning plots where you examine the same kind of plot under many different conditions

##ggplot2

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

implementation of the *Grammar of Graphics* by Leland Wilkinson

written by Hadley Wickham while he was a graduate student at Iowa State

a "third" graphics system for R, along with *base* and *lattice*

www.ggplot2.org

- think 'verb' 'noun' and 'adjective' for graphics

you want to shorten the distance from mind to page

allows for a 'theory' of graphics


qplot()
works much like the plot() function in base graphics

looks for data in a data frame, similar to lattice, or in the parent environment

plots are made up of aesthetics(size, shape, color) and geoms(points, lines)

factors are important for indicating subsets of the data(if they are to have different properties); they should be labeled

the qplot() hides what goes on underneath, which is okay for most operations

ggplot() is the core function and very flexible for doing things qplot() cannot do.



```{r}
library(ggplot2)
str(mpg)
```



```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)
```



modifying aesthetics &classifying by drv column

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)

```

front wheel drives have the highest milage

adding a geom (a summary)

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, geom = c("point", "smooth"))
```

smooth is the blue line that goes accross


```{r}
qplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv)
#plotting histograms by specifying only one variable
```

facets

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, facets = .~drv)
#if you don't want to look at the same graph with different
#colour data, you can separate the data into different facets
```

```{r}
qplot(hwy, data = mpg, facets = drv ~ ., binwidth = 2)
```

next lecture example not in R

--


you can do logs of variables

qplot(log(eno), data = maacs, fill = mopos)

qplot(log(eno), data = maacs, geom = "density")

qplot(log(pm25), log(eno), data = maacs, shape = mopos, color = mopos)

+ geom_smooth(method = "lm")

#qplot summary
syntax somewhere in between base/lattice

produces very nice graphics, essentially publication ready

if you want to customize, use full power of ggplot function

##PArt 3

basic components of a ggplot2 plot

- data frame

-aesthetic mappings

- geoms : geometric object like points, lines, shapes

-facets : for conditional plot

-stats : statistical transformations like binning, quantiles, smoothing

-scales : what scale an aesthetic map uses. example male= red, female = blue

-coordinate system


when building plots in ggplot2, the artist's palette model may be the closest analogy.

plots are built up in layers

-plot the data
-overlay a summary
- metadata and annotation


qplot(logpm25, NocturnalSympt, data = maacs, facets = . ~bmicat, geom = c("point", "smooth"), method = "lm")

working with ggplot

head(maacs[, 1:3])

g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))

summary(g)

print(g) 
Error : No layers in plot

p <- g + geom_point() #save and print ggplot object
print(p)

g + geom_point() #plot object without saving

defaults are used in geom_point() function because the data has the defaults in ggplot object

##Part 4

adding more layers: smoth

g + geom_point() + geom_smooth()

or

g + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") #to eliminate the noise in the default method

facets

g + geom_point() + facet_grid(.~ bmicat) + geom_smooth(method = "lm")

the order doesn't matter, as long as it's between point and smooth function

labels come from the levels of factor variables. you can use them

#annotation

labels : xlab(), ylab(), labs(), ggtile()

each of the 'geom' functions has options to modify

for thins that only make sense globally, use theme()
like theme(legend.position = "none")

two standard appearance themse are included
theme_gray() : default theme
theme_bw() : more stark/plain black and white



g + geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 4, alpha = 1/2)

important thing here is, the color, size and alpha are set to constants. you can assign data variables instead of constants.

alpha is transparency

+ labs(x = expression("log PM[2.5]"), y = "NocturnalSymptoms")

+geom_smooth(size = 4, linetype = 3, method = "lm", se = FALSE)

linetype = 3 is dotted line

+theme_bw(base_family = "Times") 
change the theme to black and white, and change the font to *Times*


##Part 5

notes about axis limits

when there are outliers, you may not want to look at the outlier. 

if you do this:

g + geom_line() + ylim(-3, 3)

ggplot function excludes the outlier data. it takes a subset of your data. so your outlier is not included 

but if you do this:

g + geom_line() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-3, 3))
then ggplot also includes the outlier into the plot, but doesn't concentrate on it.

so. if you don't want to lose the outlier, use coord_cartesian(ylim = ...)


#more complex examples

varying by 2 variables

NO2 variable is a continuous variable. you can't condition on a continuous variable.so you need to categorize the variable.

cut()

calculate the deciles of the data
cutpoints <- quantile(maacs$logno2_new, seq(0, 1, length = 4), na.rm= T)

cut the data at the deciles and create a new factor variable
maacs$no2dec <- cut(maacs$logno2_new, cutpoints)

see the levels of the newly created factor variable

levels(maacs$no2dec)



g <- ggplot(maacs, aes(logpm25, NocturnalSympt))

g + geom_point(alpha = 1/3) #add points
 + facet_wrap(bmicat ~ no2dec, nrow = 2, ncol = 4) #make panels
  + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = F, col = "steelblue")#add smoother
  + theme_bw(base_family = "Avenir", base_size = 10) #change theme
  + labs(x = expression("log " * PM[2.5]))
  + labs(y = "Nocturnal Symptoms")
  + labs(title = "MAACS Cohort")
  
  

you could save this to a new object. then you could add more layers.


#summary

ggplot2 is very powerful and flexible if you learn the 'grammar' and the various elements that can be tuned/modified

ggplot2 part 1
ggplot2 part 2
ggplot2 extras


##Lattice Plotting System

| The lattice system, as the base does, provides several different plotting
| functions. These include xyplot for creating scatterplots, bwplot for
| box-and-whiskers plots or boxplots, and histogram for histograms. There are
| several others (stripplot, dotplot, splom and levelplot), which we won't cover
| here.

| Lattice functions generally take a formula for their first argument, usually of
| the form y ~ x. This indicates that y depends on x, so in a scatterplot y would be
| plotted on the y-axis and x on the x-axis.

| Here's an example of typical lattice plot call, xyplot(y ~ x | f * g, data). The f
| and g represent the optional conditioning variables. The * represents interaction
| between them. Remember when we said that lattice is good for plotting multivariate
| data? That's where these conditioning variables come into play.

```{r}
xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind | as.factor(Month), data = airquality, layout = c(5, 1))
```

```{r}
p <- xyplot(Ozone ~ Wind,, data = airquality)
names(p)
```

| We see that the trellis object p has 45 named properties, the first of which is
| "formula" which isn't too surprising. A lot of these properties are probably NULL
| in value. We've done some behind-the-scenes work for you and created two vectors.
| The first, mynames, is a character vector of the names in p. The second is a
| boolean vector, myfull, which has TRUE values for nonnull entries of p. Run
| mynames[myfull] to see which entries of p are not NULL.



> p[["formula"]]
Ozone ~ Wind

| You got it right!

  |================================                                         |  43%
| Not surprising, is it? It's a familiar formula. Now look at p's x.limits. Remember
| the double square brackets and quotes.


source(pathtofile("plot2.R"), local = TRUE)

diamonds dataset

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
myxlab <- "Carat"
myylab <- "Price"
mymain <- "Diamonds are Sparkly!"
xyplot(price ~ carat | color * cut, data = diamonds, strip = FALSE, pch = 20, xlab = myxlab, ylab = myylab, main = mymain)

```
| Recall that there were 7 colors and 5 cuts in the data.

```{r}
xyplot(price ~ carat | color * cut, data = diamonds, pch = 20, xlab = myxlab, ylab = myylab, main = mymain)

```


#Working With Colors

| Of course, color choice is secondary to your data and how you analyze it, but
| effectively using colors can enhance your plots and presentations, emphasizing the
| important points you're trying to convey.

grDevices package offers colors() function

plot(x, y, pch = 19, col = rgb(0, .5, .5))

| Well this picture is okay for a scatterplot, a nice mix of blue and green, but it
| really doesn't tell us too much information in the center portion, since the
| points are so thick there. We see there are a lot of points, but is one area more
| filled than another? We can't really discriminate between different point
| densities. This is where the alpha argument can help us. Recall your plot command
| (use the up arrow) and add a 4th argument, .3, to the call to rgb. This will be
| our value for alpha.
lot(x, y, pch = 19, col = rgb(0, .5, .5, .3))

'



| Our last topic for this lesson is the RColorBrewer Package, available on CRAN,
| that contains interesting and useful color palettes, of which there are 3 types,
| sequential, divergent, and qualitative. Which one you would choose to use depends
| on your data.



| As an example of this, create a new object, cols by calling the function
| brewer.pal with 2 arguments, 3 and "BuGn". The string "BuGn" is the second last
| palette in the sequential display. The 3 tells the function how many different
| colors we want.


cols <- brewer.pal(3, "BuGn")
showMe(cols)

```{r}
showMe <- function(cv){
  myarg <- deparse(substitute(cv))
  z<- outer( 1:20,1:20, "+")
  obj<- list( x=1:20,y=1:20,z=z )
  image(obj, col=cv, main=myarg  )
}

```

pal <- colorRampPalette(cols)

showMe(pal(3))
showMe(pal(20))


```{r}

cols <- brewer.pal(3, "BuGn")
pal <- colorRampPalette(cols)

image(volcano, col = pal(20))
```

##GGPLOT Part 1

mpg dataset in ggplot2 package

| Now let's add a second geom to the default points. How about some smoothing
| function to produce trend lines, one for each color? Just add a fifth argument,
| geom, and using the R function c(), set it equal to the concatenation of the two
| strings "point" and "smooth". The first refers to the data points and second to
| the trend lines we want plotted. Try this now.

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, color = drv, geom = c("point", "smooth"))

```

| Notice the gray areas surrounding each trend lines. These indicate the 95%
| confidence intervals for the lines.


```{r}
qplot(y = hwy, data = mpg, color = drv)
```

| What's this plot showing? We see the x-axis ranges from 0 to 250 and we remember
| that we had 234 data points in our set, so we can infer that each point in the
| plot represents one of the hwy values (indicated by the y-axis). We've created the
| vector myhigh for you which contains the hwy data from the mpg dataset. Look at
| myhigh now.

| Comparing the values of myhigh with the plot, we see the first entries in the
| vector (29, 29, 31, 30,...) correspond to the leftmost points in the the plot (in
| order), and the last entries in myhigh (28, 29, 26, 26, 26) correspond to the
| rightmost plotted points. 

#So, specifying the y parameter only, without an x
| argument, plots the values of the y argument in the order in which they occur in
| the data.

```{r}
qplot(drv, hwy, data =mpg, geom = "boxplot")
```

box and whiskers plot

```{r}
qplot(drv, hwy, data =mpg, geom = "boxplot", color = manufacturer)
```


histograms
```{r}
qplot(hwy, data = mpg, fill = drv)
```


| We'll do two plots, a scatterplot and then a histogram, each with 3 facets. For
| the scatterplot, call qplot with 4 arguments. The first two are displ and hwy and
| the third is the argument data set equal to mpg. The fourth is the argument facets
| which will be set equal to the expression . ~ drv which is ggplot2's shorthand for
| number of rows (to the left of the ~) and number of columns (to the right of the
| ~). Here the . indicates a single row and drv implies 3, since there are 3
| distinct drive factors. Try this now.


##GGplot part 2

| Obviously, there's a DATA FRAME which contains the data you're trying to plot.
| Then the AESTHETIC MAPPINGS determine how data are mapped to color, size, etc. The
| GEOMS (geometric objects) are what you see in the plot (points, lines, shapes) and
| FACETS are the panels used in conditional plots. You've used these or seen them
| used in the first ggplot2 (qplot) lesson.

| There are 3 more. STATS are statistical transformations such as binning,
| quantiles, and smoothing which ggplot2 applies to the data. SCALES show what
| coding an aesthetic map uses (for example, male = red, female = blue). Finally,
| the plots are depicted on a COORDINATE SYSTEM. When you use qplot these were taken
| care of for you.

```{r}
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg, geom = c("point", "smooth"), facets = .~ drv)
```

```{r}
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy))

g + geom_point()

g + geom_point() + geom_smooth()
#too much noise
g + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
#aah, better

g + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm") + facet_grid(.~ drv)

g + geom_point(color = "pink", size = 4, alpha = 1/2)



```


| Now we'll modify the aesthetics so that color indicates which drv type each point
| represents. Again, use g and add to it a call to the function geom_point with 3
| arguments. The first is size set equal to 4, the second is alpha equal to 1/2. The
| third is a call to the function aes with the argument color set equal to drv. Note
| that you MUST use the function aes since the color of the points is data dependent
| and not a constant as it was in the previous example.

```{r}
g + geom_point(size = 4, alpha = 1/2, aes(color = drv))
```


```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + labs(title = "Swirl Rules!") + labs(x = "Displacement", y = "Hwy Mileage")
```

```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = drv), size = 2, alpha = 1/2) + geom_smooth(size = 4, linetype = 3, method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```

| What did these arguments do? The method specified a linear regression (note the
| negative slope indicating that the bigger the displacement the lower the gas
| mileage), the linetype specified that it should be dashed (not continuous), the
| size made the dashes big, and the se flag told ggplot to turn off the gray shadows
| indicating standard errors (confidence intervals).

```{r}
g + geom_point(aes(color = drv)) +theme_bw(base_family = "Times")
```


g + geom_line() + coord_cartesian(ylim = c(-3 ,3))
instead of 
g + geom_line() +ylim(-3, 3)

```{r}
g <- ggplot(mpg, aes(x = displ, y = hwy, color = factor(year)))
g + geom_point() + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, margins = TRUE)
```


```{r}
g + geom_point() + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, margins = TRUE) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 2, color = "black")
```



```{r}
g + geom_point() + facet_grid(drv ~ cyl, margins = TRUE) + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, size = 2, color = "black") + labs(x = "Displacement", y = "Highway Mileage", title = "Swirl Rules!")
```
