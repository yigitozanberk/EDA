## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Principles of Analytic Graphics


Edward Tufte www.edwardtufte.com
Beautiful Evidence

# -Principle 1 : Show Comparisons
evidence is always relative to another competing hypothesis
always ask "compared to what?"

sets of control groups and experiment groups

important to show comparison "to what"


# -Principle 2 : Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
what is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

why does the outcome occur? the cause:

Symptom free days graph, fine particulate matter graph to support the hypothesis that air cleaner cleans the air and helps the lungs of the astma children

# -Principle 3 : Show multivariate data

multivariate = more than 2 variables
the real world is multivariate
need to 'escape flatland'

outdoor air pollution graph

1 -higher air pollution lower mortality rate ile paralel gidiyor

2- multivariate data, spring accross different seasons. the relationship is now slightly positive.
***Simpson's Paradox***

# -Principle 4 : Integration of evidence
completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
don't let the tool drive the analysis
(make the plot you want to make)

-graph on coarse particulate matter and hospitalization rates

# -Principle 5 : Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
a data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

# -Principle 6 : Content is king.
analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of the content


## Exploratory Graphs

- to understand data properties
- to find patterns in data
- to suggest modeling strategies
- to debug analyses
- to communicate results

#characteristics of exploratory graphs
they are made quickly
a large number are made
the goal is for personal understanding
axes/legends are generally cleaned up later
color/size are primarily used for information

#Air pollution dataset

are there any countries in the u.s. that exceed that national standard for fine particle pollution?

```{r}
library(datasets)

pollution <- read.csv("avgpm25.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "factor", "numeric", "numeric"))

head(pollution)

#pm25 for average of 2008-2010




```


Simple summaries of data

one dimension

-five-number summary
-boxplots
-histograms
-density plot
-barplot


```{r}

#five-number summary (includes mean)
summary(pollution$pm25)

```


```{r}
boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")

```

```{r}

hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green")
rug(pollution$pm25) #plots all the points under the histogram
#you can see exactly where are the entries

```

a bit more detail about the shape of the distribution

the bulk is centered around 10

```{r}

hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green", breaks = 100)
rug(pollution$pm25)


```



```{r}
boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
abline(h = 12)
#to see what counties are above and below the line
```


```{r}
hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green")
abline(v = 12, lwd = 2)
abline(v = median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd = 4)


```

```{r}
barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main = "Number of Counties in Each Region")
```



##Exploratory Graphs 2

two dimensions
-multiple/overlayed 1-D plots(lattive/ggplot2)
-scatterplots
-smooth scatterplots

- > 2 dimensions
-overlayed/multiple 2-D plots; coplots
-use color, size, shape to add dimensions
-spinning plots(interactive/not the easiest solution)
-actual 3-D plots(not that useful)


```{r}
boxplot(pm25 ~ region, data = pollution, col = "red")
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,1), mar = c(4,4,2,1))
hist(subset(pollution, region == "east")$pm25, col = "green")
hist(subset(pollution, region == "west")$pm25, col = "green")
```

#Scatterplot
```{r}
with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25))
abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

adding color to create depth
```{r}
with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25, col = region))
abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```
multiple scatterplots
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))
with(subset(pollution, region == "west"), plot(latitude, pm25, main ="West"))
with(subset(pollution, region = "east"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "East"))
```

##Plotting Systems in R

3 core plotting systems

# 1)Base Plotting System
artist's pallette model
start with blank canvas and build up from there
start with plot function(or similar)
use annotation functions to add/modify(text, lines, points, axis)


as long as you're keeping track of what you do

plot()

**convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data**

can't go back once plot has started. need to plan in advance

difficult to 'translate' to others once a new plot has been created(no graphical "language")

plot is just a series of R commands

```{r}
library(datasets)

data(cars)

with(cars, plot(speed, dist))


```


you could add title, lines, etc.

# 2) the Lattice system

plots are created with a single function call(xyplot, bwplot, etc)

most useful for conditionings types of plots: looking at how y changes with x across leves of z

things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is specified at once

**good for putting many many plots on a screen**

downsides:

sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call

annotation in plot is not especially intuitive

use of panel functions and subscripts difficult to wield and requires intense preparation

cannot 'add' to the plot once it is created

```{r}
library(lattice)

state <- data.frame(state.x77, region = state.region)

xyplot(Life.Exp ~ Income | region, data = state, layout = c(4, 1))


```

# 3) ggplot2 system

splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways

automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to annotate by 'adding' to a plot

superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive to use

default mode makes many chioces for you(but you can still customize to your heart's desire)

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data = mpg)


```

##Base Plotting System (part 1)

the core plotting engine in R is encapsulated in the following packages:

-graphics

-grDevices

the lattice plotting system is implemented using:

-lattice

-grid

#making a plot

where will the plot be made? on the screen? in a file?

how will the plot be used?
is the plot for viewing temporarily on the screen

will it be presented in a web browser?

will it eventually end up in a paper that might be printed?

are you using it in a presentation?

is there a large amount of data going into the plot? or is it just a few points?

do you need to be able to dynamically resize the graphic?


what graphics system will you use: base, lattice, or ggplot2? you can't mix them

-we focus on using the base plotting system to create graphics on the screen device on this class

#base graphics

2-D graphics

there are two phrases to creating a base plot
-initializing a new plot
-annotating an existing plot

calling plot() or hist() will launch a graphics device and draw a new plot on the device

?par will show a lot of parameters in plot

```{r}
library(datasets)

hist(airquality$Ozone) ##Draw a new plot
```

```{r}
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
```


```{r}
airquality <- transform(airquality, Month = factor(Month))
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, airquality, xlab = "Month", ylab = "Ozone(ppb)")
```
#Some important base graphics parameters

pch : plotting symbol(default circle)

lty : line type(solid line), dashed, dotted, etc.

lwd : line width

col : plotting color

xlab : x axis label

ylab : y axis label

par() for speficying global graphics parameters that affect all plots in an R session

las : orientation of the axis labels on the plot

bg : background color

mar : margin size

oma : outer margin size(default 0)

mfrow : number of plots  per row, column(filled row-wise)
mfcol : number of plots per row, column (filled column-wise)

to see defaults

```{r}
par("lty")
```

```{r}
par("mar")
#first number : bottom - 5 lines of margin
#second : left - 4 lines of margin
# third : top - 2 lines of margin
# fourth : right - 2 lines of margin
# it goes clockwise

```

```{r}
par("mfrow")
```


#Base plotting system (part 2)

plot: makes a scatterplot, or other type of plot depending on the class of the object being plotted

lines: add lines to a plot, given a vector x values and a corresponding vector of y values(or a 2-column matrix); this function just connects the dots

points : add points to a plot

text : add text labels to a plot using specified x, y coordinates

title: add annotations to x, y axis labels, title, subtitle, outer margin

mtext : add arbitrary text to the margins(inner or outer) of the plot

axis: adding axis ticks/labels

```{r}
library(datasets)
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone))
title(main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City")
```

```{r}
with(airquality, plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind in New York City"), pch = 20)
with(subset(airquality, Month == 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "blue"))
with(subset(airquality, Month != 5), points(Wind, Ozone, col = "red"))
legend("topright", pch = 1, col = c("blue", "red"), legend = c("May", "Other Months"))
model <- lm(Ozone ~ Wind, airquality)
abline(model, lwd = 2)

```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,3), mar = c(4, 4, 2, 1), oma = c(0, 0, 2, 0))
with(airquality, {
        plot(Wind, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Wind")
        plot(Solar.R, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Solar Radiation")
        plot(Temp, Ozone, main = "Ozone and Temperature")
        mtext("Ozone and Weather in New York City", outer = TRUE)
})
```

## Base Plotting Demonstration

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
hist(x)

```

```{r}
y <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y)
```

```{r}
z <- rnorm(100)

plot(x, z)
```

```{r}
plot(x , y , pch = 20)
```

```{r}
plot(x, y, pch = 15)
```

```{r}
plot(x, y, pch = 3)
```

```{r}
example(points) #great to remember!
```

for items from 21 through 25, you can set boundary with col, and background line colour with bg

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- rnorm(100)
z <- rnorm(100)
plot(x, y, pch = 20)
title("Scatterplot")
text(-2, -2, "label")
legend("topleft", legend = "Data", pch = 20)
fit <- lm(y ~ x)
abline(fit)
abline(fit, lwd = 3)
abline(fit, lwd = 3, col = "blue")
plot(x, y, xlab = "weight", ylab = "height", main = "scatterplot", pch  = 20)


```
```{r}
z <- rpois(100, 2)

par(mfrow = c(2,1))
plot(x , y, pch = 20)
plot(x, z , pch = 19)
```


```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
plot(x, y , pch = 20)
plot(x, z , pch = 14)
```



the points function

```{r}
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- x + rnorm(100)
g <- gl(2, 50)
g <- gl(2, 50, labels = c("male", "female"))
plot(x, y) # you can't differentiate
plot(x, y, type = "n")#make the plot but don't put the data yet
#adding one group at a time
points(x[g == "male"], y[g == "male"], col = "green")
points(x[g == "female"], y[g == "female"], col = "blue")
#you can also change the symbol

```

##Graphic Devices 

#what is a graphics device

something where you can make a plot appear

- a window on your computer(screen device)
- a pdf file (file device)
- a png or jpeg file(file device)
- a scalable vector graphics(svg) file (file device)

most common place for a plot to be sent is the screen device
- on mac quartz()
- on windows windows()
- on linux/unix x11()

list of devices is found in ?Devices

on a given platform(mac, windows, unix/linux), there is only one screen device


for plots that may be printed out or be incorporated into a document, using a file device is more appropriate

there are many different file devices to choose from

you cannot launch windows() on a mac

#How does a plot get created

1- call a plotting function

2- plot appears on the screen device

3- annotate plot if necessary

4- enjoy

```{r}
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser Data")
```

second approach to plotting is most commonly used for file devices:

1- explicitly launch a graphics device

2- call a plotting function to make a plot
it will not appear on the screen

3- annotate plot if necessary

4 - expliocitly close graphics device with dev.off()VERY IMPORTANT

```{r}
pdf(file = "myplot.pdf")
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser Data")
dev.off()

```

#graphics file devices

vector formats, and bitmap devices

vector:

-pdf
-scg
-win.metafile
-postscript

bitmap:

-png
-jpeg
-tiff
-bmp

it is possible to open multiple graphics devices, for example when viewing multiple plots at once

plotting can only occur on one graphics device at a time

currently active graphics device can be found by calling dev.cur()

every open graphics device is assigned an integer >= 2

you can change the actuve graphics device with dev.set(<integer>) where <integer> is the number associated with the graphics device you want to switch to

#copying plots

-dev.cpoy: copy a plot from one device to another

-dev.copy2pdf : specifically copy a plot to a PDF file
faster, more convenient

```{r}
with(faithful, plot(eruptions, waiting))
title(main = "Old Faithful Geyser Data")
dev.copy(png, file = "geyserplot.png")
dev.off()
```

***copying a plot is not an exact operation, so the result may not be identical to the original***
