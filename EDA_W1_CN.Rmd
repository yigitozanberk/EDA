## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Principles of Analytic Graphics


Edward Tufte www.edwardtufte.com
Beautiful Evidence

# -Principle 1 : Show Comparisons
evidence is always relative to another competing hypothesis
always ask "compared to what?"

sets of control groups and experiment groups

important to show comparison "to what"


# -Principle 2 : Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
what is your causal framework for thinking about a question?

why does the outcome occur? the cause:

Symptom free days graph, fine particulate matter graph to support the hypothesis that air cleaner cleans the air and helps the lungs of the astma children

# -Principle 3 : Show multivariate data

multivariate = more than 2 variables
the real world is multivariate
need to 'escape flatland'

outdoor air pollution graph

1 -higher air pollution lower mortality rate ile paralel gidiyor

2- multivariate data, spring accross different seasons. the relationship is now slightly positive.
***Simpson's Paradox***

# -Principle 4 : Integration of evidence
completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
don't let the tool drive the analysis
(make the plot you want to make)

-graph on coarse particulate matter and hospitalization rates

# -Principle 5 : Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, etc.
a data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible

# -Principle 6 : Content is king.
analytical presentations ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance, and integrity of the content


## Exploratory Graphs

- to understand data properties
- to find patterns in data
- to suggest modeling strategies
- to debug analyses
- to communicate results

#characteristics of exploratory graphs
they are made quickly
a large number are made
the goal is for personal understanding
axes/legends are generally cleaned up later
color/size are primarily used for information

#Air pollution dataset

are there any countries in the u.s. that exceed that national standard for fine particle pollution?

```{r}
library(datasets)

pollution <- read.csv("avgpm25.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "character", "factor", "numeric", "numeric"))

head(pollution)

#pm25 for average of 2008-2010




```


Simple summaries of data

one dimension

-five-number summary
-boxplots
-histograms
-density plot
-barplot


```{r}

#five-number summary (includes mean)
summary(pollution$pm25)

```


```{r}
boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")

```

```{r}

hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green")
rug(pollution$pm25) #plots all the points under the histogram
#you can see exactly where are the entries

```

a bit more detail about the shape of the distribution

the bulk is centered around 10

```{r}

hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green", breaks = 100)
rug(pollution$pm25)


```



```{r}
boxplot(pollution$pm25, col = "blue")
abline(h = 12)
#to see what counties are above and below the line
```


```{r}
hist(pollution$pm25, col = "green")
abline(v = 12, lwd = 2)
abline(v = median(pollution$pm25), col = "magenta", lwd = 4)


```

```{r}
barplot(table(pollution$region), col = "wheat", main = "Number of Counties in Each Region")
```



##Exploratory Graphs 2

two dimensions
-multiple/overlayed 1-D plots(lattive/ggplot2)
-scatterplots
-smooth scatterplots

- > 2 dimensions
-overlayed/multiple 2-D plots; coplots
-use color, size, shape to add dimensions
-spinning plots(interactive/not the easiest solution)
-actual 3-D plots(not that useful)


```{r}
boxplot(pm25 ~ region, data = pollution, col = "red")
```

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,1), mar = c(4,4,2,1))
hist(subset(pollution, region == "east")$pm25, col = "green")
hist(subset(pollution, region == "west")$pm25, col = "green")
```

#Scatterplot
```{r}
with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25))
abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

adding color to create depth
```{r}
with(pollution, plot(latitude, pm25, col = region))
abline(h = 12, lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```
multiple scatterplots
```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1, 2), mar = c(5, 4, 2, 1))
with(subset(pollution, region == "west"), plot(latitude, pm25, main ="West"))
with(subset(pollution, region = "east"), plot(latitude, pm25, main = "East"))
```
